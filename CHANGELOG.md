## Unreleased

### Added

- A vendor's sign-out is told to KIFF once, when the grant turns
  `needs_reconnect`, so the people who see the taf hear of it at once. A
  notice KIFF didn't take is sent again by the hourly sweep, for up to a week;
  one whose grant was signed in again is dropped.
- Every grant carries `status_words`: its status in the owner's words, so the
  apps show the same line for a connection and keep no words of their own.
- A connected grant gains tools with one approval and no second sign-in,
  while its tools keep working (kiff/tafs#138). The asking agent lists the
  grants it asked for a taf's agent, to add to them.
- Deleting the account, signed from the owner's phone, erases everything
  planque keeps for it: tools out of KIFF, vendor tokens revoked, records and
  the enrolment deleted (kiff/tafs#185).
- Security reporting, contribution and agent guidance, issue and pull-request
  templates, code owners, and dependency-update configuration.
